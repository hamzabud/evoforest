# EvoForest

## Overview

EvoForest is a simulation tool designed to facilitate experiments and analysis in the context of evolutionary algorithms and forest modeling. This repository contains all necessary scripts, datasets, and visualization outputs to support the experiments presented in the associated research paper.

## Repository Structure

### `src` Folder

The `src` folder contains the core source code for the simulation. This includes:

- **Simulation Logic (tree.py)**: The main evolutionary framework.
- **Experiment Scripts**: Individual scripts tailored to run specific experiments for each dataset.
- **Datasets**: The datasets used in the experiments.
- **Results**: The results from the experiments in CSV files.

### `plots` Folder

The `plots` folder contains all the visual outputs generated from the experiments. This includes:

- **Plots**: Visualizations created from the experimental data.
- **Miscellaneous Figures**: Other figures used in the paper for illustrative purposes.

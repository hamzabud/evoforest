# Welcome!

The src folder contains the source code for the simulation.

## Version 1

This is the version where we compare the performance of evolving a forest using **Scikit-learn** trees. The code is in the `src` folder.
Experiments can be found in the [experiments notebook](https://github.com/hamzabud/thesis/blob/main/src/experiments.ipynb).

### Current Status

Complete and stable. The performance is meh, and the prediction accuracy is sometimes comparable to the Scikit-learn trees and sometimes not.

## Version 2

This is the version where we compare the performance of evolving a forest by building custom trees (essentially random) and evolving them. The code is in the `src_v2` folder.
Experiments can be found in the [experiments notebook](https://github.com/hamzabud/thesis/blob/main/src_v2/experiments.ipynb).

### Current Status

The build is stable, and the performance is not too bad, but the prediction accuracy is not as good as the Scikit-learn trees.
